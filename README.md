# Machine-Learning-Concepts

Implementing various machine learning concepts in Python (i.e. Linear Regression, SVM, Logistic Regression, K-NN, Clustering).

**Assignment 1**: 
Data analysis and visualisation on 20 newsgroups dataset:

* Exploration of the dataset (i.e. basic data visualisation and displaying).
* Naive Bayes classification (i.e. Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest classifier, confusion matrices).

**Assignment 2**: 
Continuation of Assignment 2. Linear regression on automobile pricing dataset:

* Simple Linear Regression 
* Multivariate Linear Regression
* One-hot encoding, N-fold cross-validation

**Assignment 3**: 
Object recognition based on bag of visual words:

* Exploration of the dataset (i.e. dataset visualisation)
* Experiments involving various SVM classifiers (i.e. different kernels)

**Assignment 4**: 
Continuation of Assignment 3. Feature Engineering:

* Clustering (i.e. K-Means)
* PCA
* Comparison with previous methods (i.e. Naive Bayes, SVMs)
